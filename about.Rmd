### About

As research increasingly becomes multi-disciplinary, attending and
presenting at seminars and workshops in related departments can help
facilitate cross-discipline collaboration and be a source for expert
feedback.  Up until now, information barriers have made it difficult
for researchers at UH-Manoa to know what was going on outside your
department, where, and when.  UHM Allied Seminars and Workshops
reduces these barriers by providing a centralized listing of upcoming
seminars and workshops for departments with the potential for
overlapping research.  Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to
keep up with active research across departments, and in doing so
provide the opportunity for greater cross-disciplinary interaction.
