**Comparing and Combining Statistical Models and Crop Models with Implications for Climate Change**

**Abstract**:  Two distinct approaches have been used to evaluate how climate change will affect agricultural output.  One approach takes data and assumptions about soils, solar radiation, management practices and projected daily rainfall and temperatures, and feeds these through process-based mathematical models of plant growth and seed formation.   Impacts from climate change are drawn from differences in yields simulated using historical and projected future weather.  The second approach uses statistical regression models to link historical yield outcomes to historical weather and extrapolates from observed associations to make predictions about yield under an altered projected climate.  The two approaches have different strengths and weaknesses.  Our goal this paper is to compare and combine the two approaches using a large new data set that spans a majority of actual maize fields in the United States. Comparison of each model's predictions with actual outcomes allows us to see the circumstances for which each model makes more accurate predictions, and thereby aid future model refinements. Also, by combining models we can likely make more accurate predictions about the potential impacts of weather or climate change.
        
  The results indicate similar predictive accuracy between the baseline statistical model (Schlenker and Roberts 2009) and the process-based crop model (Muchow, Sinclair and Bennet, 1990), with the process-based model slightly out-predicting the statistical model after post-model calibration.  The combined model significantly out-predicts both models,  with Davidson-McKinnon non-nested J-tests rejecting the null hypothesis that either model is sufficient without inclusion of the other.  Prediction accuracy varies widely by geography, with both models predicting better in warmer and drier regions.  Finally, we consider predictions each model and the combined model under simple climate change scenarios.  These predictions indicate that the statistical model and the combined model have much more negative impacts from warming due to an extreme heat effect not captured by the process model.

**How do farmers manage their biodiversity through time? A dynamic acreage allocation model with productive feedback**

**Abstract**:  Agriculture has negative impacts on biodiversity. However, biodiversity contribute to landscape functioning and have thus positive effects on agricultural yields which differ according time. Few studies focus on this two-way causality relationship between biodiversity and agriculture. On the one hand, most of economic studies examine only the negative effects of agriculture on biodiversity, mostly through ex post analysis of farmers’ choices. On the other hand, the only studies focusing on farmers’ management of landscape functionalities, generally don’t consider farmers’ economic behaviour in their analysis. This paper aims to overcome these issues in order to understand how farmers manage their biodiversity through time. We examine this question through a dynamic primal model of farmers’ economic behaviour which allows quantifying the relationships between agriculture and biodiversity. We consider biodiversity as a quasi-fixed input whose management depend on past and current acreage choices. In order to account for both farmers’ dynamic strategic choices and dynamic biodiversity we include adjustment costs derived from investment literature. We estimate our structural model on milk farms of north-west of France. We distinguish two kind of biodiversity according to their habitat and measure it through the utilization of landscape metric indicators which have been developed by landscape ecologists.

**Abstract**:  The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of cigarette pricing in military retail outlets on the demand for tobacco products among U.S. active duty military (ADM) members.  Although studies of cigarette demand in civilian samples have shown that young, male, poorer, minority consumers are more sensitive to prices, little is known about the individual behavior and economic implications of such market activity in the military context. This paper aims to fill the gap and to add new evidence on the impact of price, in the interactive presence of stress, on tobacco use. Combining the 2011 Department of Defense Health Related Behaviors Survey (HRBS) of Active Duty Military Personnel with 2011 pricing data (see Poston et al., 2016), the effects of on-base discount pricing of cigarette sales on the consumption patterns of stressed cigarette smokers among ADM is examined. Results include that stressors, such as depression and combat duty, adversely drive ADM personnel’s demand for cigarettes.  In addition, price elasticities of consumption vary consistently with exposure to deployment-related stress.  Estimates of price sensitivity were robust to the frequency, intensity and recency of tobacco use.  The SECDEF’s Policy Memorandum 16-001, issued April 8th, 2016, on the Department of Defense’s review of tobacco policy reinforces the timely, significant and interdisciplinary nature of my study, intersecting at the crossroads of economics, epidemiology and public policy.
