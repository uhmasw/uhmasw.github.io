**Comparing and Combining Statistical Models and Crop Models with Implications for Climate Change**

**Abstract**:  Two distinct approaches have been used to evaluate how climate change will affect agricultural output.  One approach takes data and assumptions about soils, solar radiation, management practices and projected daily rainfall and temperatures, and feeds these through process-based mathematical models of plant growth and seed formation.   Impacts from climate change are drawn from differences in yields simulated using historical and projected future weather.  The second approach uses statistical regression models to link historical yield outcomes to historical weather and extrapolates from observed associations to make predictions about yield under an altered projected climate.  The two approaches have different strengths and weaknesses.  Our goal this paper is to compare and combine the two approaches using a large new data set that spans a majority of actual maize fields in the United States. Comparison of each model's predictions with actual outcomes allows us to see the circumstances for which each model makes more accurate predictions, and thereby aid future model refinements. Also, by combining models we can likely make more accurate predictions about the potential impacts of weather or climate change.
        
  The results indicate similar predictive accuracy between the baseline statistical model (Schlenker and Roberts 2009) and the process-based crop model (Muchow, Sinclair and Bennet, 1990), with the process-based model slightly out-predicting the statistical model after post-model calibration.  The combined model significantly out-predicts both models,  with Davidson-McKinnon non-nested J-tests rejecting the null hypothesis that either model is sufficient without inclusion of the other.  Prediction accuracy varies widely by geography, with both models predicting better in warmer and drier regions.  Finally, we consider predictions each model and the combined model under simple climate change scenarios.  These predictions indicate that the statistical model and the combined model have much more negative impacts from warming due to an extreme heat effect not captured by the process model.
